# Dentistry-SQL-Database
My team and I were given the task of creating a simulated database to be used by a new dental office.

Within this repository, you can find our final report on the project, outlining the full details of our database and its features. You can also find four .txt files which contain different SQL scripts. CreateQuery.txt includes an SQL script to generate an empty SQL database with our specific requirements. InsertQuery.txt includes an SQL script to fill the database with sample data to allow for different queries to be requested from the database. SimpleQuery.txt and ExtraQuery.txt hold SQL scripts that query and request specific data from the database to prove its functionality.

For specific information on the details of this database or the queries made on it, please refer to Final Project Report.pdf.
